## Overview

Robot Motion Controller:

The following code describes the motion of a 4 wheeled robot with the 2 front wheels using DC-motors to control the turning and motion.

The code is meant to interface with a path-planning algorithm which gives the robot a desired position and orientation at described time increments. 

With the input from the path-planning algorithm the code determines what current and voltage to feed the DC-motors in order to drive the front wheels to desired outputs specified by the path-planner, or in the case of the simulation, the path-planner output file.

A simulation is performed with a simple 2-D physics simulator of the top-down view of the robot with robot.chassis describing the length and width of the robot. The robot is made to follow a path described in the path-planning output file and that is the extent of the simulation. There is no level of intelligence within the code, nonetheless various proximity sensors were also included in the simulation in case future design and testing of the path-planning / motion controller systems in unision.
